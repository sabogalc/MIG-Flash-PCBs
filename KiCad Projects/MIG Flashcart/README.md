# MIG Flashcart

### NOTE
This board is currently untested. Given my analysis of the board and its similarities to the Dumper (which has been fully tested), I have about 85% certainty that this board will work, but a full test will be conducted in the future. Additionally, the board is missing capacitor measurements for most of its capacitors, but I will also address this at some point.

### Overview
The Flashcart board is very compact, and it would be very challenging to assemble it by hand. Most of the passive components are the 0201 size, and the 0404 RGB LED in the top right is also extremely small. Additionally, the vias have been trimmed down to a 0.2mm size to accommodate the board's routing.

### Ordering Specifications
To ensure this board fits in the game enclosure and that it can be read, it should be ordered as a 0.8mm thick board with an ENIG finish. All other options can be left as their default.

### Contributing Capacitor Measurements or Testing the Board
If you have any information regarding the missing capacitor measurements, please reach out or submit a pull request. The same goes for if you are able to order, build, and test this board, though I plan on doing both of these myself eventually.

### KiCad 3D View
